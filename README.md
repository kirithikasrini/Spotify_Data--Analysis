# Spotify Data Analysis using SQL and Query Optimization 

## Objective  
This project analyses a Spotify dataset containing various attributes using SQL. It involves an end-to-end process that includes normalizing a denormalized dataset, executing SQL queries across different levels of complexity and optimizing query performance. The project's main objectives are to enhance advanced SQL skills and extract meaningful insights from the dataset. 

## Dataset
The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset 

**Dataset Link:** [Spotify Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjanchaudhari/spotify-dataset)

## Project Steps 
### 1. Data Exploration
### 2. Querying the Data 
After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the data.
### Practice Question
1.Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams.

2.List all albums along with their respective artists.

3.Get the total number of comments for tracks where licensed = TRUE.

4.Find all tracks that belong to the album type single.

5.Count the total number of tracks by each artist.

6.Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album.

7.Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values.

8.List all tracks along with their views and likes where official_video = TRUE.

9.For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.

10.Retrieve the track names that have been streamed on Spotify more than YouTube.

11.Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.

12.Write a query to find tracks where the liveness score is above the average.

13.Use a WITH clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album.

### 3.Query Optimization
 **Initial Query Performance Analysis Using EXPLAIN**
 
**Index Creation on the artist Column**

**Performance Analysis After Index Creation**
